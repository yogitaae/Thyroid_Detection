# Thyroid Detection
I have developed a tool using Python and different ML models to detect thyroid diseases. The user-friendly front end is created with Streamlit. 

The model I built predicts three statuses based on thyroid hormone levels:

1. Normal: when thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range.
2. Hyperthyroidism: when thyroid hormone levels are higher than normal.
3. Hypothyroidism: when thyroid hormone levels are lower than normal.

The reference ranges used to predict are taken from a reputable lab, which may vary in the future or even from one test to another.
